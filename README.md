# Semantic Layer for the UK Biobank Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Quality Assessment

Image quality assessment is fundamental as it affects the level of confidence in any output obtained from image analysis. 
Clinical research imaging scans  do  not  often  come  with  an  explicit  evaluation  of  their  quality,  however
reports are written associated to the patient/volunteer scans. This rich free-text documentation has the potential to 
provide automatic image quality assessment if efficiently processed and structured. This work aims at showing how the use
of Semantic Web technology for structuring free-text documentation can provide
means for automatic image quality assessment. We aim to design and implement
a **semantic layer** and a **knowledge graph** for a special dataset, the annotations made in the context of the
UK Biobank Cardiac Cine MRI pilot study. This semantic layer in combination with the representation power of the knowledge graph will be a powerful tool to automatically infer or validate quality scores for clinical images and
efficiently query image databases based on quality information extracted from the
annotations. Our approach has the potential to be extended to broader projects and ultimately employed in the clinical setting.

## Source dependencies

The instructions below work for python 3.10 on Linux machine Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS

### Create virtual environment within main directory
* Ensure you are in the main directory of the project
``` pwd``` should give you ``` <my folder for the git repo>/cmr-qa-semantic-layer/src```
* Create a virtual environment using venv
```python -m venv .venv```
* Activate the virtual environemnt BEFORE installing any package/library
```source .venv/bin/activate```
* Install using pip
```pip install pandas```

* [Owlready2](https://pypi.org/project/Owlready2/): ```pip install Owlready2```
* [RDFLib](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gettingstarted.html): ```pip install rdflib```
